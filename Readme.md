Storytime
After jailbreak came out, it's been over 10 years. Developers like luca opened there source for community to study and learn coding from it. But this has been changed until Electra team. By the day this license was written, they still didn't opened their source of Chimera, Sileo and so on. Yes, they have their right to keep it close sourced, while I'm performing my right to keep them away from my work.

License Structure
The license is split into four parts, depending on your role. Role matching is done from top to bottom in the order they are listed below. Note that the latest version of the license text always applies instead of the old version.
